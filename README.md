# Inokufu Search - Moodle TinyMCE Plugin

The Inokufu Search - Moodle TinyMCE plugin is a part of the Inokufu Search Moodle Plugin set, which also includes the Inokufu Search - Moodle Repository plugin. This Moodle TinyMCE plugin simplifies the interaction with the Inokufu Search - Moodle Repository plugin, by enabling users to embed content from the Moodle Repositories directly into the TinyMCE text editor.
This documentation will guide you through the installation and usage of the plugin.
